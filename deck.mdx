# Deployment at Shift Lab
---
 ## A roughly organized series of thoughts around deployment practices across all projects
---
## Problems and Considerations
* We need to know what is deployed/not deployed at any given time
* We need client buy-in for when deployments go live
* We need to ensure transparency with clients throughout the deployment process
---
## Open Question: What are some other deployment pain points?
---
## Current Solutions
* PDF documents detailing each deployed version w/ manually drafted changelogs
* Contact client on Basecamp, Slack, Pivotal, to schedule + prepare deployments
* Require developer availability + advance scheduling for deployments
* Some projects use semantic versioning, others don't
---
## Open Question: What are some other deployment proceses we have on projects?
---
## Continuous Delivery
---
### What is Continuous Delivery?
* As much automated testing as possible
* Code is _always_ deployable
* Reduce the need for heavy integration tests, code freezes, etc
* Verify new features in a production-like environment (`staging`)
* Manually deploy `production` when feature sets are approved
* Ensure **low risk** releases
* Deploy very frequently
---
### Continuous Deployment
* Everything is the same as continuous delivery (automation, tests, etc), but every change is automatically deployed to the production environment
* This is usually not viable for us as we work in an agency setting, but we do have some projects where this happens (Netlify projects, static sites, etc)
---
## Why Continuous Delivery?
* Reduced deployment risk
* Test suites and automated builds/deployments of source code reduce the risk of regressions
* "Believable" Progress
* Acceptance for work is much easier and more convincing when it's been deployed to multiple production-like environments
* Easier and more frequent access to user feedback
* Automation around deployments to staging/QA environments means clients always have a place to go where they can see in progress or nearly complete work
---
## How can Shift move towards Continuous Delivery?
---
## Aside
* We're pretty close in some areas already
* Doesn't need to be overnight, wholesale adoption
* At the end of the day, do what works for us
* Incorporate some best practices and tweak what we need to
---
## Moving towards Continuous Delivery
* Automation, automation, automation
* Continuous Integration and a basic test suite should be the minimum for every project
* Standardize our changelog generation process and then automate it
* Use semanatic versioning and Git tags for all projects
